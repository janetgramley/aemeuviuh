I am back for my second month to serve you :D I wish Netflix would create a subcategory called 'Titles Leaving Soon' or more bluntly, 'Titles Being Removed'. This is an incomplete list. Items that are bolded are titles that are in my personal list. Feel free to contribute in the comments section, I will add once confirmed. We have only a matter of days to watch these titles in Canada before they are gone. Credit goes to unogs.com for filling. A lot to unpack; this is all thanks to u/Mr_Freeload: The Episode begins with Jon and Daenerys arriving in Winterfell, just like the lineup scene in Season 1 Episode 1 with Robert Baratheon; everyone is present other than Arya (likely for her and Jon's reunion later). Bran tells everyone that "they don't have time for this, the Night King is coming." Bran also tells Daenerys about Viserion, which she is shocked about, but apparently not shocked enough. Sansa is unhappy So, one of my friends brought up a post they made about nine months ago. https://www.reddit.com/r/rpghorrorstories/comments/91s1y6/yeah\_he\_has\_an\_ability\_that\_instantly\_kills\_you/ (https://www.reddit.com/r/rpghorrorstories/comments/91s1y6/yeah_he_has_an_ability_that_instantly_kills_you/) this one, specifically. They never came back to write a part 2, and I didn't know about it until today. In one comment, they mentioned they weren't the only female pc. Well, me and my girlfriend. TL;DR: Cersei is a mad genius and just sent Dany to her grave. The Azor Ahai prophecy states: "There will come a day after a long summer when the stars bleed and the cold breath of darkness falls heavy on the world. In this dread hour a warrior shall draw from the fire a burning sword. And that sword shall be Lightbringer, the Red Sword of Heroes, and he who clasps it shall be Azor Ahai come again, and the darkness shall flee before him. " Brandon Stark had a vision of a single dragon.

If you're a new reader, start with the prelude here! (https://www.reddit.com/r/resonatingfury/comments/auu409/the_rerewrite_of_dreams_my_first_novel_attempt/) Previous Chapter (8) (https://www.reddit.com/r/resonatingfury/comments/bisk3k/lost_in_a_dream_chapter_8) --- Thoughts swirled through my mind like the creamy orange smoothie in my blender. What was that all about? Does she hate me now? Am I disgusting? Maybe my breath smelled bad. Why did I bring these pretzels So I just recently reread all of the Ice and Fire books and have a few theories about how this series is going to come to an end. It’s gonna be a long read, so buckle in! Winterfell: \-The Living lose at Winterfell \-Theon dies protecting Bran \-Jon and Daenerys see that the Godswood is falling \-Jon says he has to go save Bran \-Daenerys tries to hold off as long as she can with Drogon \-Jon lands in the Godswood, fights off a White Walker General or two \-After realiz. 
I‘ve noticed a lot of posts lately looking for ideas. These should be free or low cost ones for various ages: (hopefully I didn't repeat myself too often!) 1. Riddle treasure hunt ("this is where I lay my head, every night to go to bed" - run to pillow, etc) 2. Treasure map hunt. This is much harder, but I found success in drawing up a map, but not putting where x marks the spot. I used a lot of props, and clues. I took lots of pictures, and made a story book out of them. 3. Scavenger hunt. Now be me, I am a adept Dungeonmaster and I was asked to takeover for a friend who was in a really troublesome group. I have started to learn how to put my foot down and enforce the rules and be much more of a DM because of a major incident that happened in a Sunday Group I ran earlier this year. Long story short it ended in one of my players almost jumping across the table at me. After that my friend attempted to run the Mines of Phandelver Module for 5e for a group of people.

The Archangel of Power fires dozens of bolts from both palms, narrowly missing the agile Emperor as she dodges from left to right. "Hold still. Thou art only delaying the inevitable." His voice, calm as a lake on a summer day, betrays no emotion. However, he narrows his eyes and glares at her with a slight hint of bubbling rage. "Thou </p>
